- What is process mining according to Veit et al. (2017)? #card
	- A technique to reconstruct, analyze, and improve business processes using event data from transactional IT systems.
- What is the typical starting point of process mining analysis? #card
	- Explorative investigation of a process model reconstructed from raw event data.
- What is the goal of manual process discovery? #card
	- To identify deviations, undesired patterns, and inefficiencies in processes.
- Why is process data often enriched beyond event logs? #card
	- To enable deeper analysis using additional business attributes (e.g., order value, quantity).
- What advanced analyses become possible with enriched process data? #card
	- OLAP-style analysis with multiple dimensions and KPIs.
- What types of improvements are triggered by process mining insights? #card
	- Reduced throughput time, less manual work, improved quality, and efficiency gains.
- What is a key limitation of traditional explorative process mining? #card
	- It requires manual investigation and prior hypotheses from the user.
- Who is the “driving force” in traditional process mining? #card
	- The human analyst.
- What problem does the Proactive Insights Engine (PI) address? #card
	- The need for automated, intelligent process insights without manual exploration.
- What is the core innovation of the Proactive Insights Engine (PI)? #card
	- Combining process mining with machine learning to generate automated insights.
- What capabilities does PI provide? #card
	- Automatic analysis, root-cause detection, and prescriptive recommendations in real time.
- How does PI change traditional process mining? #card
	- It shifts from explorative discovery to intelligent, fully automated process analysis.
- What is PI Conformance? #card
	- Automated comparison of the actual (“as-is”) process with the documented (“to-be”) process.
- What inputs can PI Conformance use? #card
	- Imported BPMN models or models created using the built-in process modeler.
- What outputs does PI Conformance produce? #card
	- Ranked process violations, root causes, and recommendations for fixes.
- On what basis are PI recommendations generated? #card
	- Statistical significance and business relevance indicators.
- What is PI Machine Learning? #card
	- Native integration of machine learning and statistical algorithms into process mining.
- Which language is supported for advanced analytics in PI? #card
	- R (via RCALL and RAGG).
- What is the difference between RCALL and RAGG? #card
	- RCALL returns one value per input; RAGG returns aggregated values per group.
- What type of predictions can PI Machine Learning provide? #card
	- Predictive process monitoring (e.g., forecasting how cases will complete).
- What is PI Social? #card
	- A component that analyzes the social and organizational aspects of processes.
- What insights does PI Social uncover? #card
	- Critical roles, workload imbalances, and inefficient team interactions.
- How does PI Social visualize process interactions? #card
	- Through social network maps of people, teams, and organizations.
- What is PI Companion? #card
	- A process advisor embedded into operational business systems.
- What is the key advantage of PI Companion? #card
	- It supports decisions during process execution, not only after completion.
- Which enterprise system does PI Companion commonly integrate with? #card
	- SAP.
- Give an example of PI Companion decision support. #card
	- Selecting vendors based on historical delivery performance or customer payment behavior.
- How does PI align with AI-first BPM strategies? #card
	- By enabling automated, real-time, data-driven process optimization.
- How does PI extend traditional process mining value? #card
	- From descriptive and diagnostic analytics to predictive and prescriptive analytics.
- What is the overall contribution of Veit et al. (2017)? #card
	- Demonstrating how AI and ML transform process mining into an intelligent, proactive BPM capability.

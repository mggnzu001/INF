- What common claim do ERP vendors make about business processes?
  - That ERP software and its “best practices” will automatically define and improve business processes.
- Why is this claim unrealistic according to Kimberling (2012)?
  - Because ERP software cannot define optimal processes for a specific organization.
- When should business process reengineering (BPR) occur?
  - Before ERP implementation, not after.
- What is the single biggest differentiator between ERP success and failure (besides change management)?
  - Poor business process management.

  - ERP failure lawsuits, failed integrator projects, and CIO surveys.
- What do CIOs commonly attribute ERP success or failure to?
  - Effective business process management and well-designed processes.
- Why should BPR occur before ERP to maintain competitive advantage?
  - It ensures differentiating processes are preserved rather than overwritten by software constraints.
- Why can inefficient processes still be strategically important?
  - They may provide competitive differentiation despite being manual or inefficient.
- Why is ERP flexibility a risk without prior BPR?
  - Thousands of configuration decisions may be made without business guidance.

  - Around 10,000.
- Who makes these decisions if processes aren’t defined?
  - Technical consultants, often in a vacuum.
- Why are ERP “best practices” considered a myth?
  - They reflect how the software works, not how the business should operate.
- Which functions are exceptions to this critique?
  - Standard back-office functions like HR and accounts payable.
- What approach does Kimberling recommend instead?
  - Lean Six Sigma.
- Why is Lean Six Sigma preferred?

- Why does early BPR accelerate benefits realization?
  - Some improvements can be implemented without ERP software.
- Give an example of a pre-ERP process improvement.
  - Introducing PO approval workflows using email.
- Why is early change beneficial from a change management perspective?
  - Gradual change (“spoon feeding”) is easier for employees to adopt.
- What does “paving the cowpaths” mean?
  - Automating broken or inefficient existing processes.
- Why does this happen during ERP implementations?
  - Time pressure and high consultant costs discourage redesign.
- How does early BPR reduce ERP costs and timelines?
  - It allows technical teams to configure software against defined processes.
- What are the benefits of performing BPR before ERP?
  - Faster implementation, lower costs, better adoption, and higher success rates.

- Why is TCO often neglected?
  - ERP projects focus mainly on budget vs actual costs.
- How does TCO help ERP projects?
  - Identifies over-customization
  - Limits unnecessary configuration

- What is over-customizing in ERP?
  - Excessive configuration that increases complexity without business value.

  - They show how improvements in one area lead to outcomes in others.
- What makes this aspect innovative?
  - It links operational, learning, customer, financial, and project outcomes.
- When does traditional ERP investment control usually end?
  - At system delivery to users.
- What phase is often under-measured?
  - The productive (use) phase of ERP.
- What do Rosemann & Wiese propose instead?
  - Ongoing, computerized, multi-dimensional performance measurement.
- What is the central lesson from Rosemann & Wiese (1999)?
  - ERP performance should be measured continuously using a Balanced Scorecard, beyond financial KPIs, covering both implementation and long-term use.
- How do Deloitte (2022) and Rosemann & Wiese (1999) align conceptually?
  - Both argue that value creation requires better governance and broader performance measurement, not narrow short-term financial metrics.
- Why is IT spending difficult to justify?
  - Business benefits are hard to identify, measure, and prove—known as the information paradox.
- What is the “information paradox”?
  - The gap between increasing IT investment and the difficulty of demonstrating corresponding business value.
- Why is the belief that “more IT investment is always good” flawed?
  - Because IT alone does not create value.
- According to Thorp (2003), does IT itself deliver value?
  - No—IT delivers no value on its own.
- How is value actually created from IT investments?
  - Through how the business selects, manages, and uses IT-enabled organizational change.
- What types of changes are required to realise IT value?
  - Business model or strategy
  - Business processes

  - From tracking project delivery to full lifecycle governance focused on realised benefits.
- What is meant by activist accountability?
  - Clear ownership for benefits, not just delivery of projects.
- Why are relevant measurements important?
  - They link activities to outcomes and clarify accountability.
- What role does senior management play in benefits realisation?
  - They must proactively and visibly lead change.
- What are target benefits?
  - Strategic project goals that improve business performance once the project is completed.
- When should target benefits be identified?
  - During the project initiation phase.
- How long should target benefits be monitored?
  - Throughout the project and after completion.
- What did PMI (2016) find about target benefits identification?
  -
Common Problems with Target Benefits
- Why are target benefits often unreliable?
  - They are frequently overstated to secure funding approval.
- Why are project debriefings often avoided?
  - Unrealistic target benefits make failure visible.
- What happens if no expected benefits are identified?
  - Project success cannot be assessed.
- Why is benefits management essential?
  - To ensure realistic evaluation and actual return on investment.
- Despite academic attention, why does benefits management remain weak in practice?
  - Tools and models are limited, poorly implemented, or inconsistently applied.
- What is a key challenge of IT management related to benefits?
  - Justifying, proving, and monitoring benefits from IT investments.
- Why can’t all IT benefits be identified upfront?
  - Not all performance improvements are foreseeable.
- What is the issue of IS reach?
  - IS integrates many organizational elements, making outcomes hard to predict.
- Why are intangible benefits problematic?
  - They are difficult to link to financial performance and often ignored.
- What is benefit evolution?
  - Benefits change over time—some disappear, others emerge unexpectedly.
- Why is post-implementation evaluation critical?
  - It determines whether intended benefits were actually realised.
- What does it mean if only the technology was delivered?
  - No benefits have been realised.
- What do Ward, Taylor & Bond (1996) argue?
  - Benefits must be measured after implementation, not assumed.
- How do Thorp (2003) and Knoesen & Seymour (2019) align?
  - Both argue that benefits do not come from IT delivery, but from active benefits identification, ownership, governance, and post-implementation measurement.
- What is the core lesson of Benefits Realisation?
  - IT investments only create value when organizations actively manage change, own benefits, and govern outcomes across the full lifecycle.

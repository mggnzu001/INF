- What is the purpose of the Define (Project Preparation) phase? #card
  - To organize the project, establish scope, and prepare management, schedule, budget, and resources.
 What are key project management tasks in the Define phase? #card
  - Organizing the project team, preparing the Project Charter and Scope, defining schedule, budget, and resources.
 What IT and system architecture decisions are made in this phase? #card
  - Selecting hardware and database vendors and defining the system landscape.
- What is the main goal of the Design (Blueprint) phase? #card
  - To determine how the business will operate using the ERP system in terms of processes, not technical details.
- What is a Business Blueprint? #card
  - A detailed description of how the company intends to run its business using the ERP system.
- Why is business process modelling important in this phase? #card
  - It defines how business activities will be executed after ERP implementation.
- What role does the blueprint document play? #card
  - It serves as a template for all subsequent implementation steps.
- What problem do many ERP adopters face during design? #card
  - A mismatch between existing business processes and ERP package processes.
- What are the three ERP adoption choices described by Brehm et al. (2001)? #card
  1. Change the organization to fit the ERP
  2. Live with misfit and inefficiencies
  3. Adapt/configure the ERP to fit business needs (ideal option)
- What are key tasks in the Design phase? #card
  - Training the project team
  - Installing the development system
  - Producing the business blueprint
  - Determining the data migration strategy
- Why is requirements determination still important in ERP projects? #card
  - Because multiple configuration and implementation options increase complexity (Bollen, 2013).
- What are “delta requirements”? #card
  - The gap between ERP system functionality and the organization’s business processes.
- How should delta requirements be handled? #card
  - Planned, resolved, and added to the project backlog.
- What is the focus of the Realize phase? #card
  - Configuring and developing the ERP system to support business processes.
- How does Davenport (1998) describe ERP configuration? #card
  - As a process of compromise between business needs and ERP system constraints.
- How can the Realize phase be executed? #card
  - Through agile sprints.
- What does ERP customization involve? #card
  - Customizing the baseline system covering 100% of organizational data and about 60% of business processes.
- What types of development occur in this phase? #card
  - Modifications, enhancements, and special programs (e.g., ABAP).
- What integration activities are performed? #card
  - Connecting legacy systems and integrating third-party software.
- What testing is done during Realization? #card
  - Testing business processes, interfaces, reports, and data conversions.
- What must be ensured before ERP go-live? #card
  - The system works technically and business process configurations are practical.
- What are the two major steps in “going into production”? #card
  - Activating the productive system and transitioning from the old system.
- What are key tasks during deployment? #card
  - Setting the go-live date
  - Go-live readiness assessment
  - End-user training
  - Integration, volume, and stress testing
  - Establishing a help desk
  - Transferring legacy data
  - Transitioning to the new environment
- Why is the help desk critical after go-live? #card
  - Most user questions occur in the first few weeks of operation.
- Who should staff the help desk initially? #card
  - Project team members and consultants.
- What is the focus during the Operate phase? #card
  - System stability, performance optimization, and benefit realization.
- What tasks are performed during ERP operation? #card
  - Verifying system accuracy
  - Monitoring and optimizing performance

- What is the purpose of the Define (Project Preparation) phase? #card
  - To organize the project, establish scope, and prepare management, schedule, budget, and resources.

- What are key project management tasks in the Define phase? #card
  - Organizing the project team, preparing the Project Charter and Scope, defining schedule, budget, and resources.

- What IT and system architecture decisions are made in this phase? #card
  - Selecting hardware and database vendors and defining the system landscape.
- What is the main goal of the Design (Blueprint) phase? #card
  - To determine how the business will operate using the ERP system in terms of processes, not technical details.
- What is a Business Blueprint? #card
  - A detailed description of how the company intends to run its business using the ERP system.
- Why is business process modelling important in this phase? #card
  - It defines how business activities will be executed after ERP implementation.
- What role does the blueprint document play? #card
  - It serves as a template for all subsequent implementation steps.
- What problem do many ERP adopters face during design? #card
  - A mismatch between existing business processes and ERP package processes.
- What are the three ERP adoption choices described by Brehm et al. (2001)? #card
  1. Change the organization to fit the ERP
  2. Live with misfit and inefficiencies
  3. Adapt/configure the ERP to fit business needs (ideal option)
- What are key tasks in the Design phase? #card
  - Training the project team
  - Installing the development system
  - Producing the business blueprint
  - Determining the data migration strategy
- Why is requirements determination still important in ERP projects? #card
  - Because multiple configuration and implementation options increase complexity (Bollen, 2013).
- What are “delta requirements”? #card
  - The gap between ERP system functionality and the organization’s business processes.
- How should delta requirements be handled? #card
  - Planned, resolved, and added to the project backlog.
- What is the focus of the Realize phase? #card
  - Configuring and developing the ERP system to support business processes.
- How does Davenport (1998) describe ERP configuration? #card
  - As a process of compromise between business needs and ERP system constraints.
- How can the Realize phase be executed? #card
  - Through agile sprints.
- What does ERP customization involve? #card
  - Customizing the baseline system covering 100% of organizational data and about 60% of business processes.
- What types of development occur in this phase? #card
  - Modifications, enhancements, and special programs (e.g., ABAP).
- What integration activities are performed? #card
  - Connecting legacy systems and integrating third-party software.
- What testing is done during Realization? #card
  - Testing business processes, interfaces, reports, and data conversions.
- What must be ensured before ERP go-live? #card
  - The system works technically and business process configurations are practical.
- What are the two major steps in “going into production”? #card
  - Activating the productive system and transitioning from the old system.
- What are key tasks during deployment? #card
  - Setting the go-live date
  - Go-live readiness assessment
  - End-user training
  - Integration, volume, and stress testing
  - Establishing a help desk
  - Transferring legacy data
  - Transitioning to the new environment
- Why is the help desk critical after go-live? #card
  - Most user questions occur in the first few weeks of operation.
- Who should staff the help desk initially? #card
  - Project team members and consultants.
- What is the focus during the Operate phase? #card
  - System stability, performance optimization, and benefit realization.
- What tasks are performed during ERP operation? #card
  - Verifying system accuracy
  - Monitoring and optimizing performance
  - Measuring business benefits
- Why is software selection not the “hard part” of ERP projects? #card
  - Because most ERP systems are robust and customizable; implementation is where challenges and dissatisfaction arise.
- What happens to satisfaction rates once ERP implementation begins? #card
  - Satisfaction and perceived benefits often decline during the actual implementation phase.
- Why do benefits often fail to materialize despite choosing good ERP software? #card
  - Due to poor implementation practices, not software limitations.
- What is business process blueprinting? #card
  - The documentation, analysis, and improvement of business processes to align with ERP implementation.
- Why is business process blueprinting critical in ERP projects? #card
  - It identifies areas of improvement, supports ERP integration, and highlights training and change management needs.
- What insight does blueprinting provide to organizations? #card
  - Visibility into critical process gaps, organizational change issues, and future (“to-be”) processes.
- What percentage of companies changed business processes to fit ERP functionality? #card
  - 41%.
- According to Panorama, which processes should be changed to fit ERP software? #card
  - Non-differentiating, standardized processes (e.g., HR and accounting).
- Which processes should ERP software be adapted to fit? #card
  - Processes that provide competitive advantage or differentiation.
- What is Panorama’s key tenet regarding ERP fit? #card
  - ERP software should be changed to fit differentiating business processes, not the other way around.
- What happens when process changes are poorly managed? #card
  - They can disrupt operations and reduce ERP benefits.
- What percentage of companies struggled with process and organizational change issues? #card
  - 63%.
- What factors contribute to declining satisfaction during implementation? #card
  - Under-staffing, poor understanding of implementation, lack of user and executive buy-in.
- What are “to-be” processes? #card
  - Desired future business processes after ERP implementation.
- Why should ERP implementations focus on “to-be” processes rather than “as-is”? #card
  - Because ERP should support improved future operations, not outdated practices.
- How can “to-be” processes be defined? #card
  - Through business blueprinting and process mapping.
- What percentage of companies had little or no focus on business processes? #card
  - 19%.
- What percentage followed best practices by defining processes before ERP selection? #card
  - 13%.
- What risk do companies face if they fit ERP to old processes? #card
  - Organizational backlash and declining long-term business benefits.
- Why is benefits realization important in ERP projects? #card
  - ERP implementations are costly and must justify their financial value.
- Why must executives understand ERP benefits early? #card
  - To approve projects and set realistic expectations for returns.
- What makes it difficult to measure ERP financial impact? #card
  - Failure to identify costs and potential cost savings upfront.
- What is a business case in ERP implementation? #card
  - A document that captures costs, savings, and expected benefits of the ERP project.
- Why does Panorama recommend creating a business case? #card
  - To establish a baseline for measuring financial improvement and ROI.
- What financial metrics should organizations consider? #card
  - Breakeven point and overall return on investment (ROI).
- How should ERP benefits be evaluated over time? #card
  - By measuring how the system increases profitability beyond breakeven.

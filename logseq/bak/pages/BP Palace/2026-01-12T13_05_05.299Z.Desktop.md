Below is a **single, coherent memory palace** designed to help you **recall theory-heavy facts, ordered concepts, grouped lists, and process steps**.
It is structured so you can **walk through it in sequence**, zoom into **rooms for lists**, and **replay cycles and methodologies** for application questions.

I’ll first give you the **layout**, then walk you through **each location with vivid anchors**, explicitly preserving **all groupings and lists** from your notes.

# 🏛️ THE BUSINESS PROCESS MEMORY PALACE

**Theme:** A large **modern university / corporate campus**
**Why:** Familiar, process-oriented, easy to subdivide into departments, floors, and rooms.

You always enter at the **front gate** and move **clockwise**, then **up floors** for later “waves” and advanced material.

## 🔰 GATE & LOBBY — *What Is a Business Process*

### Location: Main Entrance Hall

**Central statue:** A conveyor belt carrying documents → products → smiling customers.

Engraved quote on the wall:

> “A set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome.”

This anchors:

* **Davenport & Short (1990)** definition
* **Davenport (1993)** emphasis on *how work is done*

### Two giant doors (core characteristics):

1. **Customer Door** – labeled *Internal & External*
2. **Boundary Door** – cuts through walls labeled *Departments*

These =
✔ Processes **have customers**
✔ Processes **cross organizational boundaries**

---

## 🧭 LOBBY SIDE ROOMS — *Identifying & Classifying Processes*

### Room 1: **Porter’s Value Chain Room**

A glowing chain running around the walls → used to **identify processes**.

### Room 2: **Process Boundaries Room**

A timeline on the floor:

* Start point
* Interfaces
* End point
* Customer unit highlighted

✔ Processes have **beginning, end, interfaces, org units**

---

## 📦 THREE GLASS DISPLAY CASES — *Process Dimensions*

Each case is impossible to miss.

### Case 1: **Entities**

* Interorganizational (EDI wires between buildings)
* Interfunctional (departments shaking hands)
* Interpersonal (two people collaborating on a screen)

### Case 2: **Objects**

* Physical objects (boxes)
* Informational objects (data sheets)

### Case 3: **Activities**

* Managerial (budget clipboard)
* Operational (worker filling an order)

👉 Always recall as **Entities → Objects → Activities**

---

## ⚠️ BASEMENT — *Business Process Problems & Advantages*

You descend a staircase (processes are “hidden”).

### Dark walls = **Problems**

* Invisible
* Not named
* Cross departments
* Hard to describe vs org charts

### Bright measuring instruments = **Advantages**

* Measurable over time:

  * Cost
  * Output
  * Efficiency
  * Quality
  * Customer satisfaction

🧠 Key contrast anchor:

> “You can’t measure or improve a hierarchy — but you can a process.”

---

## 🏗️ FLOOR 2 — *Mapping & Understanding Processes*

### Pyramid sculpture = **Process Knowledge Pyramid**

🧠 Retail vs pharma invoicing difference anchored here.

---

## 🔄 FLOOR 3 — *Wave 3: BPM as a Cycle*

### Circular hallway you must walk repeatedly

Stations in order:

1. Discover
2. Analyze
3. Redesign
4. Execute

## 📱 FLOOR 5 — *Wave 4: Customer Obsession*

### Front-office desk replaces back-office cubicles

2. **Mobile** → rapid experimentation
3. **Cognitive software** → human + AI
4. **Process mining** → event logs → insight

🧠 Always remember: **CX, Mobile, Cognitive, Mining**

---

## 🚀 FLOOR 6 — *Wave 4 Reframed*

### Digital control room

Screens show:

* Digital touchpoints

### Large diagram table:

* **I**nputs
* **G**uides (rules, policies — MOST problems here!)
* **O**utputs
* **E**nablers (people, tools, facilities)

Red laser highlights:

* 80–85% problems = **rules**, not flows

🧠 Rule changes → massive cycle time reductions

---

## 🚦 FLOOR 12 — *Process Health Check*

## ✅ HOW TO USE THIS FOR EXAMS

* **Definitions:** Stop at statues and plaques
* **Lists:** Walk hallways and count doors
* **Processes:** Walk loops and cycles
* **Application questions:** Ask “which room is broken?”

If you want, next I can:

* Convert this into a **one-page revision map**
* Create **exam-style prompts per room**
* Build **flashcards directly mapped to palace locations**

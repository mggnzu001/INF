- What were the characteristics of early information systems?
	- They were built from scratch, requiring all functionality—including data storage and retrieval—to be manually programmed.
- Why were Database Management Systems (DBMS) introduced? #card
	- Many information systems shared similar data management needs, so this generic functionality was outsourced to DBMSs.
- What type of functionality was later subcontracted to UI tools? #card
	- User interaction functionality such as forms, buttons, graphs, and other interface components.
- What general trend in information system development does this evolution illustrate? #card
	- Recurring functionality is increasingly subcontracted to generic tools instead of being custom-built.
- Where do BPM systems (BPMS) fit into this trend? #card
	- BPMS subcontract process-related aspects of information systems.

	- An architectural style where interacting services exchange messages to deliver functionality.
- How are more complex services created in SOA? #card
	- By combining multiple basic services.
- What is service orchestration? #card
	- The composition of services from the viewpoint of a single coordinating service (“spider in the web”).
- What is service choreography? #card
	- The composition of services from a global viewpoint focusing on shared and complementary observable behavior.
- In what situations is choreography particularly relevant? #card
	- When there is no single central coordinator among services.
- How do orchestration and choreography relate to each other? #card
	- They describe overlapping but distinct aspects of integrating services into end-to-end business processes.
- Why has the distinction between orchestration and choreography been debated? #card
	- Their conceptual overlap has led to extensive discussion over the past decade.
- How can SOC and SOA be used in BPM/WFM contexts? #card
	- To realize process enactment infrastructures.
- How do processes and services interact in SOC/SOA-based systems? #card
	- Processes may implement services and may also consume existing services.
- What service-related capabilities do modern BPM/WFM systems provide? #card
	- They can expose processes as services and implement process activities by invoking other services.

- What major change in business–IT relations occurred in the last decade (Harmon, 2015)? #card
	- IT came to be seen as an integral part of company strategy rather than merely a support service.
- How did the role of IT managers change in response to this shift? #card
	- They shifted focus from technology support to enabling and implementing business processes.
- What became the “common language” between business executives and IT managers? #card
	- The goals and workings of business processes.
- How did this reorientation affect IT support for business managers? #card
	- It led to a reconsideration of IT’s role and to the development of integrated BPMS software suites.
- What types of tools were historically separate but are now integrated into BPMS products? #card
	- Workflow, business intelligence, rules engines, and enterprise application integration (EAI) tools.
- How did the term BPMS change the way these tools were described? #card
	- Previously separate tools began to be grouped and marketed collectively as BPMS products.
- What was the significance of Smith and Fingar’s Business Process Management (2003)? #card
	- It called on companies to adopt BPMS to automate and manage business processes.
- What vision did Smith and Fingar have for BPMS? #card
	- Managers could monitor process performance in real time and modify processes to adapt to changing conditions.
- How did Smith and Fingar conceptualize BPMS software? #card
	- As a software layer sitting above other systems to manage people and software involved in major processes.
- Did the BPMS market emerge entirely from new vendors? #card
	- No, most BPMS vendors evolved from existing workflow, BI, EAI, rules engine, or ERP vendors.
- How did vendors adapt their existing products to align with BPMS? #card
	- By adding capabilities such as EAI, workflow, rules engines, and BI to their platforms.
- What is a key difference between today’s BPMS and workflow/EAI systems from around 2000? #card
	- Modern systems are designed to leverage the Internet and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- Can SOA projects exist without BPM? #card
	- Yes, simple SOA projects can be done without BPM.
- Why do sophisticated SOA projects require BPM? #card
	- They must be integrated with a deep understanding of organizational business processes to deliver value.
- Why have major platform vendors increased their support for BPM and BPMS? #card
	- Due to the central role SOA infrastructure plays in their platforms.
- Why is the relationship between BPMS and SOA described as a “mixed blessing”? #card
	- It increased vendor commitment but shifted focus toward technical integration over business process understanding.
- How can BPM become marginalized in SOA-driven discussions? #card
	- It may be treated as secondary to infrastructure and enterprise integration concerns.
- What common mistake do SOA developers make regarding business involvement? #card
	- They treat business input as mere “requirements” rather than engaging deeply with business processes.
- What is the core critique raised by Inaganti (2007)? #card
	- BPM often gets sidelined when SOA discussions focus too heavily on technical infrastructure.

- How is risk defined by Parente (2018)? #card
  - An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on at least one objective.
- What two properties are used to denote a risk? #card
  - Probability and impact.
- What is probability in risk management? #card
  - The likelihood that a risk will occur.

  - It reflects the possibility that a project objective will not be met under the current plan.
- What is impact in risk management? #card
  - The consequence or effect if a risk occurs.
- How is risk exposure calculated? #card
  - Risk exposure = Probability × Impact.
- Why is risk exposure important? #card
  - It helps prioritize risks based on their potential severity.
- What is the key difference between a risk and a problem/issue? #card
  - A risk may occur in the future; a problem or issue has already occurred.
- What is the purpose of risk identification? #card
  - To discover potential risks that may positively or negatively affect project objectives.
- What types of events are considered during risk identification? #card
  - Uncertain events or conditions that could impact objectives.
- What are the main steps in the risk management process? #card
  - Identification, assessment, response planning, execution, monitoring, documentation, and communication.
- What happens during risk assessment? #card
  - Risks are analyzed and evaluated based on probability and impact.
- What is risk response planning? #card
  - Developing actions to mitigate, avoid, transfer, or accept risks.
- Why are monitoring and communication important in risk management? #card

  - Risk is actively controlled rather than just insured.
- What type of risk does this course primarily focus on? #card
  - Hazards or negative risk and their controls.
- Why is risk management becoming more important for organizations? #card
  - Stricter legislation and increasing cost and difficulty of insurance.
- How do Rosemann & Zur Muehlen (2005) describe the relationship between risk and processes? #card
  - Risk is an inherent property of every business process.
- Why are techniques for identifying and analyzing process risks necessary? #card
  - To support operational risk mitigation and legal compliance.
- What is the danger of lacking process risk identification techniques? #card

  - Because risk only materializes when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
- According to Stallings & Brown (2015), what must organizations identify? #card
  - Assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.
- Why must assets be identified during risk identification? #card
  - Because risks are assessed based on their potential impact on assets.

- What is the purpose of risk analysis? #card
  - To evaluate and prioritize risks to support decision-making and risk response planning.
- What are the two main approaches to risk analysis? #card
  - Qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk analysis.
Qualitative Risk Analysis
- What is qualitative risk analysis? #card
  - The process of prioritizing risks by assessing and combining their probability and impact.
- Why is qualitative risk analysis performed? #card
  - To determine which risks require further analysis or immediate action.
- How are probability and impact combined in qualitative risk analysis? #card
  - Using a risk matrix or heat map.
- Besides financial loss, what other criteria are considered in qualitative risk analysis? #card
  - Health and safety, reputational impact, vulnerability, and speed of onset.
- Why are subjective criteria included in qualitative risk analysis? #card
  - Because not all risks can be measured purely in financial terms.
Impact Assessment

  - The severity of consequences if a risk occurs.
- What does an impact scale rating of 5 (Extreme) represent? #card
  - Severe consequences across multiple dimensions.
- Give examples of Extreme (5) impact. #card
  -
Financial loss of $X million or more

Likelihood Assessment
- What does a likelihood scale measure? #card
  - The probability that a risk will occur.
- What does a likelihood scale rating of 5 (Frequent) mean? #card
  - Almost certain; up to once every two years or ≥90% chance over the asset’s life.
- Why are likelihood scales important? #card
  - They standardize how probability is assessed across risks.
Risk Ranking and Prioritization
- What happens after risks are plotted on the risk heat map? #card
  - They are ranked from highest to lowest risk level.
- Why might initial risk rankings be adjusted? #card
  - Due to factors such as vulnerability, speed of onset, or deeper understanding of impacts.
- What is speed of onset in risk analysis? #card
  - How quickly a risk manifests once triggered.
- Why is vulnerability considered when adjusting risk rankings? #card
  - Because highly vulnerable systems increase the likelihood or severity of impacts.
Link to Risk Management

  - Cancelling a project or changing its scope because the risks and costs are too high.
- When is risk avoidance most appropriate? #card
  - When the risk exposure exceeds the organization’s risk appetite.
- What is risk acceptance? #card
  - Acknowledging the risk and accepting its consequences if it occurs.
- What typically accompanies risk acceptance? #card
  - Contingency planning.
- When is risk acceptance appropriate? #card
  - When the cost of mitigation exceeds the potential impact of the risk.
- What is risk transference? #card
  - Shifting the impact and responsibility of a risk to a third party.
- Give examples of risk transference. #card
  - Insurance policies and fixed-price contracts.
- Why transfer risk instead of avoiding it? #card
  - When another party can manage the risk more effectively.
- What is risk mitigation? #card
  - Reducing the probability and/or impact of a risk through controls.
- Give an example of risk mitigation. #card
  - Building redundancy into a system.
- How does mitigation differ from avoidance? #card
  - Mitigation reduces risk, while avoidance eliminates the activity entirely.
- What is meant by controls in risk mitigation? #card
  - Measures put in place to reduce likelihood or impact of a risk event.
Opportunity-Focused Responses
- What does exploit mean in risk management? #card
  - Maximizing the probability and/or impact of a positive risk (opportunity).

  - Increased losses, missed opportunities, or strategic failure.
- What is risk appetite? #card
  - The amount and type of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives.
- Can an organization have different risk appetites for different objectives? #card
  - Yes, risk appetite varies by objective, activity, and risk type.
General Risk Appetite Examples

  - Willingness to accept higher losses to achieve higher returns.
- What does a low risk appetite for risky ventures imply? #card
  - The organization invests cautiously and limits potential losses.

Step 5 – Monitor Controls
- What is Step 5 of the e-Business Risk Model? #card
  - Ongoing monitoring of process controls.

Approaches to Achieving Compliance
- What are the two main approaches to achieving compliance? #card
  - Retrospective reporting and automated detection.
- What is retrospective reporting? #card
  - After-the-fact compliance detection through traditional audits, often manual and consultant-driven.
- What are the drawbacks of retrospective reporting? #card

  - Using software tools that automatically generate audit reports by checking system configurations and logs.
- Which enterprise systems are commonly used for automated compliance checks? #card
  - SAP HR, LDAP directories, groupware, and other enterprise systems.
- What is a major limitation of automated detection approaches? #card
  - They rely on hard-coded checks and lack long-term sustainability.
Sustainable Compliance Approach

Process & Controls Relationship
- How are process management and controls management related? #card
  - Controls are embedded within processes to ensure compliance and risk reduction.
- Why is integrating controls into processes important? #card
  - It enables proactive, sustainable compliance rather than reactive enforcement.
Key Takeaways

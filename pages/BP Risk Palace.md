# 🏛️ THE MEMORY PALACE:

## “THE BUSINESS RISK & PROCESS MUSEUM”

Imagine a **large corporate museum** with **floors**, **rooms**, and **exhibits**.
You always enter at the **front doors**, go **left to right**, then **floor by floor**.

---

## 🟦 FLOOR 1 — FOUNDATIONS OF RISK

### 🚪 ROOM 1: “WHAT IS RISK?”

At the entrance is a **glass pedestal with a ticking clock and a scale**.

#### Central Exhibit: Definition of Risk (Parente, 2018)

* The **clock** = *uncertain future event*
* The **scale** has:

  * **Left plate: Probability**
  * **Right plate: Impact**
* A **digital display multiplies them** → **Risk Exposure**

➡️ **Risk Exposure = Probability × Impact**

#### Wall Plaques

* **Probability** = likelihood of occurrence
* **Impact** = consequence if it occurs

#### Contrast Corner (Very Important)

* **Foggy doorway labeled “RISK”** → may occur (future)
* **Broken glass labeled “ISSUE / PROBLEM”** → already occurred

👉 This room anchors: **definitions, distinction, formula**

---

### 🚪 ROOM 2: THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS (ORDER MATTERS)

A **conveyor belt** moves through **6 stations** (walk alongside it):

1. 🔍 **Identification**
2. 📊 **Assessment**
3. 🧠 **Response Planning**
4. ⚙️ **Execution**
5. 👁️ **Monitoring**
6. 🗂️ **Documentation & Communication**

Each station stamps the same project folder as it passes.

➡️ Use the conveyor to recall **sequence under exam pressure**.

### 🚪 ROOM 3: THREE AGES OF RISK (Sadgrove, 2016)

### 🚪 ROOM 7: RISK ANALYSIS

Split into **two zones**.

#### Zone A: Two Big Questions

Two glowing questions on the wall:

2. 🌍 Global negative media
3. ⚖️ Prosecution & incarceration
4. 🚑 Fatalities/injuries
5. 🚪 Senior leaders leaving

#### Likelihood Scale (Frequent = 5)

* “Once in 2 years”
* “Almost certain”
* “≥ 90% chance”

After heat map:
➡️ **Rank risks**
➡️ Adjust using:

* Vulnerability
* Speed of onset
* Nature of impact
